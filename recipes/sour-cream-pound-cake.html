    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>This easy<strong> Sour Cream Pound Cake </strong> recipe is rich, buttery, and incredibly moist with a perfectly tender crumb. It’s a classic, easy-to-make bundt cake that’s perfect for any occasion.</em></p>
    <p>I’ve always had a soft spot for pound cake, especially when it’s moist, rich, and totally irresistible, like this one! Fun fact: the name “pound cake” comes from way back in the 1700's when bakers used a pound each of butter, sugar, flour, and eggs. That’s a lot of cake! Thankfully, we’ve refined things a bit since then, and the secret to this cake's dreamy texture is sour cream (or full-fat Greek yogurt if that’s what you have on hand). It bakes up thick, golden, and perfectly tender every time. I love it plain, with berries, or even the next day for breakfast.</p>
